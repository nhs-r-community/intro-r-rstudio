## Projects

## Working Directory

If you tell R/R Studio to look for a file, or save a plot, it will (by default) look in a place called the working directory (wd)

## Change overall default Working Directory

Often defaults to the `Documents` folder but can be changed in `Tools/Global Options`

## Bookmarks

A Project can make it easier to find tell your session where to get files from and where to save them but, like bookmarks, you can:

::: incremental
-   share this location with others
-   move between projects easily
:::

## Project menu

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 1

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 2

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/project-wizard.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the project wizard when new Project... selected" class="center"/>
:::
:::

::: notes
People on the cloud can't follow this currently but it's recommended to review this once on a computer.

For those who have set up their own computers this will be needed for the unzipped data folder that was downloaded in order to see the Files in the bottom pane.
:::

## Project Type and Name wizards

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 3

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/project-type.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the project type list starting with New Project but includes R Package and Shiny Application" class="center"/>

::: {.column width="50%"}
Step 4

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/project-name.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the project name wizard where the location can also be changed" class="center"/>
:::
:::

::: notes
Show creating a new directory, for example Quarto website as all the template files are also created.

Then show create in an existing directory for the benefit of those working on their own computers.

Note how the name is derived from the folder.
:::

## Have a go! *Not for the RStudio Cloud*

1.  Create a project in an existing folder using the Project menu.  
2.  Note the name of the `.Rproj` file that is generated automatically.  
3.  Create a new project, this time choosing the selection `Shiny Application`. What files are created?
4.  Using the Project menu move between the two projects.

Extra: Delete one of the `.Rproj` files and then try to select it from the menu. What happens?

## Browsing in RStudio

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Click the three dot icon in the bottom right quadrant, Files tab:
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

## Getting back to the working directory

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
First way:

Click the grey arrow next to the file pathway `~/` in the Console

</br> <img src="img/session-projects/working-directory.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the working directory name and grey arrow found in the Console."/>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Second way:

Once a project has been created an R hex logo appears in the Files tab next to the three dots
