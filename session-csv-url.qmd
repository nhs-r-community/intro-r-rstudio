## URLs imports

Sometimes it's easier to directly retrieve the csv files from the source on the internet. 

This removes a step in the Reproducible Analytical Pipeline where a person is required to save the file to import.


## Importing csvs using {readr}

We will use the "Import Dataset" button which is the same way to get csv files from a computer:

<img src="img/session03/import-screenshot.PNG" alt="Screenshot of RStudio with Import Dataset drop down button highlighted as well as the file capacity_ae.csv in the Files tab." class="center" width="80%"/>

## File location - using a url

Instead of selecting a file, instead type the following into the top box and press `Update`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/main/tb_cases.csv`

this will give the following code in the wizard (as well as a preview of the data)

```{r}
library(readr)
tb_cases <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/main/tb_cases.csv"))
```
