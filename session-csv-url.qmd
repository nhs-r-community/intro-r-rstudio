## URLs imports

Sometimes it's easier to directly retrieve the csv files from the source on the internet. 

This removes a step in the Reproducible Analytical Pipeline where a person is required to save the file to import.


## Importing csvs using {readr}

We will use the "Import Dataset" button which is the same way to get csv files from a computer:

## File location - using a url

Instead of selecting a file, instead copy the url into the `File/URL` box next to `Browse`

```
https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/culture-and-community/digital/internet-use/latest/downloads/by-ethnicity.csv
```

. . .

Browse changes to `Update` which will pressed will give a preview and the code is:

```{r}
library(readr)
by_ethnicity <- read_csv(url("https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/culture-and-community/digital/internet-use/latest/downloads/by-ethnicity.csv"))
```
