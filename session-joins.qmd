## Relational data

```{r}
#| label: "libs"
#| include: false
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(countdown)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: "load-data"
tb_cases <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/main/tb_cases.csv"))
tb_pop <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/main/tb_pop.csv"))
tb_new_table <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/main/tb_new_table.csv"))

```

It's rare to find all the data you need for an analysis in a single table.

Typically, you'll have to link two (or more) tables together by matching on common "key" variable(s).

We use joins in SQL or R, (V, H or X) LOOKUPs in Excel

## Joins

All the joins in SQL are available in R and a couple more called `filtering joins` which have the same concept as `EXISTS` used in the `WHERE` clause in SQL.

## left_join()

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Keep structure of table `x`

...and match to observations in table `y`

"key" variable (common to both tables)

```{r}
x |> 
  left_join(y, by = "id")
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Have a go!

We're going to join two tables one with cases of tuberculosis by country, one with population by country.

Import the files:

`tb_cases.csv`  
`tb_pop.csv`  
`tb_new_table.csv`

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## Join 2 tables together

When columns have the same name R resolves this conflict by adding `.x` and `.y` to the end of the column name

```{r}
#| eval: true
tb_cases |> 
  left_join(tb_pop, by = "country")
```

## Join on multiple columns

Explicitly joining on more than one column requires the use of a vector

```{r }
tb_cases |> 
  left_join(tb_pop, by = c("country", "year"))
```

and as of 2023 now:

```{r}
tb_cases |> 
  left_join(tb_pop, join_by(country, year))
```


## Default combine

{dplyr} joins can occur automatically

```{r}
#| eval = TRUE
tb_cases |> 
  left_join(tb_pop)
```

## Joining with different names

If two tables have different names for same variable:

```{r}
tb_cases |> 
  left_join(tb_new_table, by = c("country" = "Place",
                                 "year" = "Yr"))
```

as of 2023

```{r}
tb_cases |> 
  left_join(tb_new_table, by = join_by(country == Place,
                                       year == Yr))
```

## semi_join()

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Semi-joins retain the data on the left if it matches the right, but drops the right (so is not like an inner join that keeps both sides).

All rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`.

## Use Case - hospital Covid tests

Finding hospital patients who have had a Covid-19 test but only bring back the information on the hospital, nothing about the test.

Join to the `tb_new_table` and bring back only those records where the column `FirstLetter` is 'A' but drop the data from `tb_new_table.`

```{r}
# Create a new data frame to join to
lookup_table <- tb_new_table |> 
  filter(FirstLetter == "A")

tb_cases |> 
  semi_join(lookup_table, by = join_by(country == Place,
                                       year == Yr))
```

## anti_join()

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
All rows from `x` where there are not matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
[![Moving gif that only retrains from the left table what doesn't match on the right](img/session08/anti-join.gif){.center alt="Moving gif that only retrains from the left table what doesn't match on the right"}](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain)

## Use Case - text mining stop words

In text mining, exclude 'stop words' (but, and, or) which are kept in a separate table for reference.

Join to the `tb_new_table` and exclude only those records where the column `FirstLetter` is 'A' .

```{r}
tb_cases |> 
  anti_join(lookup_table, by = join_by(country == Place,
                                       year == Yr))
```
