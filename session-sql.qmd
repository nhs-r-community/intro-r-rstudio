## SQL connections

- A great number of data sources are via SQL servers

::: incremental
- R and SQL process in different architecture (SQL is often more powerful depending on the computer processing speed)

- Packages are available to either use whole SQL scripts or use R functions to process data in the SQL environment
:::

## Connection packages

Firstly the connection needs to be set up using 2 libraries:

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
```



!!! **These have not been pre-loaded to the Posit Cloud to prevent connection to an insecure area** !!!

## Connection string

Three areas are specific to the user and database

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4|5|6"

con_udal <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = odbc::odbc(),
  driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server",
  server = serv,
  database = db,
  UID = user,
  authentication = "ActiveDirectoryInteractive"
)
```

:::notes
Debatable how much needs to be hidden as this is authenticated by the Active Directory but for reference.
:::

## Save important credentials

The {usethis} package has many useful functions including:

```{r}
library(usethis)
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

## Amending .Renviron 

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. Copy the following directly to `.Renviron` with no spaces 
1. Amend to your specific details in the quotes
1. Save the `.Renviron` file `Ctrl+S` and Restart RStudio using `Ctrl+Shift+F10` or `Session/Restart R`

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
server="server_name"
db="db_name"
user="name.surname@email.uk"

```

## Connect in the Quarto document

1. Create a new R chunk with <img src="img/icons/notebook-insert-chunk.png" alt="A picture of the green square with c button from RStudio to create a new chunk"/> or using `Ctrl+Alt+i`
1. Copy the code below
1. Run the code chunk using the green arrow in top right

```{r connection}
con_udal <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = odbc::odbc(),
  driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server",
  server = serv,
  database = db,
  UID = user,
  authentication = "ActiveDirectoryInteractive"
)
```

## SQL code in R

A single SQL script can be run within R.

Each temporary table needs its own script or combine in a CTE (common table expression).

```{r}
df_one <- dbGetQuery(
  conn = con_udal,
  statement = "

  SELECT  appointment_date,
          appointment_status,
          HCP_Type,
          Count_Of_Appointments
  FROM  Schema_Name.Table_Name
  WHERE Appointment_Date >= '2022-11-25'
  "
  )
```
