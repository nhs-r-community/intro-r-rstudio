## Wrangling

Is the reshaping or transforming of data into a format which is easier to work with  

This is often the largest part of many analyses and data science

## A note on tidy data

Tidyverse functions work best with tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column.
1. Each observation forms a row.

(Broadly, this means long rather than wide tables)


## {dplyr} package

- {dplyr} is a language for data manipulation  

:::incremental
- Most wrangling puzzles can be solved with knowledge of just a few {dplyr} verbs or functions 
- Many of the concepts of these functions exist in SQL but {dplyr} (and other packages) can extend this further
:::

## Some functions/verbs to start with

Some key verbs will help us gain a deeper understanding of our data sets.

Note `summarise()` can also be spelt `summarize()`

```{r}
dplyr::arrange()
dplyr::filter()
dplyr::mutate()
dplyr::summarise()
```

::: notes
Some of these may make sense, arrange/filter, mutate may be new and group_by may be a false friend to SQL users as it conceptually does different things - it doesn't distinct (use `distinct()` or `unique()`)
:::

## Building with steps

These verbs aren't used independently of each other. 

Each can be a step in the code, like a recipe but can also be repeated.

A recipe starts with:

> potato then  
peel then  
slice into medium sized pieces then  
boil for 25 minutes then  
mash

## Recipe as code

The potato is the object in R terms and the steps are verbs or functions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Take a `potato` then  
`peel` then  
`slice` into medium sized pieces then  
`boil` for 25 minutes then  
`mash`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
`potato |> `  
`peel() |> `  
`slice(size = "medium") |> `  
`boil(time = 25) |> `  
`mash()`
:::
:::

the `|>` can be replaced with the word 'then' in this recipe scenario

## Pipe

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Shortcut key `Ctrl+Shift+m`

You might be familiar with the pipe `%>%` from {magrittr} and in {tidyverse} but the new pipe `|>` doesn't require any packages to run
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Q1. Which organisation provided the highest number of Mental Health beds?

## arrange()

Reorder rows based on selected variable

```{r}
beds_data |> 
  arrange(beds_av)
```

## Descending data

We need descending order:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"

beds_data |> 
  arrange(desc(beds_av))
```

`desc()` works for text and numeric variables

## Q2. Which 2 organisations provided the highest number of MH beds in September 2018?

::: incremental
- We'll use `arrange()` as before to get the "highest number"
- But we require only observations with the date "September 2018"
:::

## filter()

The expression inside brackets should return TRUE or FALSE.
We are choosing rows where this expression is TRUE.

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
beds_data |> 
  filter(date == "2018-09-01") 
```
</br>
  
::: {.fragment .fade-in}

### A negative test of equality

To exclude and test where the expression is NOT equal `!=`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
beds_data |> 
  filter(date != "2018-09-01") 
```
:::


## Ordered and filtered

`filter()` first to reduce the number of rows to apply the next code to

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3"
beds_data  |> 
  filter(date == "2018-09-01") |> 
  arrange(desc(beds_av)) 
```

::: notes
This is a small dataset but useful to `filter()` early on in code to reduce the computational load - can make a big difference when data frames are millions of rows.
:::


## Find the top 2 organisations

This isn't a key function but useful and there are many other functions for `slice...`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
beds_data  |> 
  arrange(desc(beds_av)) |> 
  filter(date == "2018-09-01") |> 
  slice_head(n = 2)
```

## Q3. Which organisations had the highest percentage bed occupancy in September 2018?

::: incremental
- We'll use `arrange()` as before to find "highest"
- We'll use `filter()` as before to restrict by date "September 2018"
- But we don't have a percentage variable in the data
:::

## Create new variables

= in this context is an alias not a test of equality

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2|4"
beds_data |> 
  mutate(perc_occ = occ_av / beds_av) |> 
  filter(date == "2018-09-01") |> 
  arrange(desc(perc_occ)) 
```

::: notes
Point out the differences between top two as both are 100 percent but very different sizes. Without denominators we can't really be sure what's happening.
:::

## Q4. What was the mean number of beds (for the dataset)?

::: incremental
- Let's first look at how we'd produce summary statistics like a mean
- And then see how this can be applied to groups of data like organisations
:::

## summarise()

Collapses a single summary value

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
beds_data |> 
  summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av))
```

## Missing values

We'll need to remove NA (not available) values to get a suitable mean. `TRUE` can also be `T`

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
beds_data |> 
  summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av,
                             na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

## Have a go!

Instead of `mean()` use `median()`

```{r}
object |> 
  summarise(new_name = function_name(column_name,
                                     na.rm = ???))

```


Use a `sum()` statistic twice

```{r}
object |> 
  summarise(col_1 = function_name(beds_av,
                                  na.rm = ???),
            col_2 = function_name(occ_av,
                                  na.rm = ???)
)

```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## Answer for summary statistics

`median()`

```{r}
#| eval: true
beds_data |> 
  summarise(median_beds = median(beds_av,
                                 na.rm = TRUE))
```

`sum()`

```{r}
#| eval: true
beds_data |> 
  summarise(total_beds = sum(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_occupacy = sum(occ_av, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Applying `summarise()` to groups

::: incremental
- Now we know how to use `summarise()`
- We'll produce a summary value for **each value of date**
:::

## group_by() - temporary grouping

New for 2023 grouping can be added into the functions directly so is temporary.

Also used in `filter()` and `slice()` functions.

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
beds_data |> 
  summarise(mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE),
            .by = date)
```

## group_by() - persistent grouping

`group_by()` is a function that you may see in other code. 

It does nothing to the output alone.  
The change occurs behind the scenes. 

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
beds_data |> 
  group_by(date) 

```

## ungroup()

## Break? 

Option to take this break before an exercise or after

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## Q5. Which organisations have the highest mean % bed occupancy? 

:::incremental
- `summarise()` using sum() for `total_beds` and `total_occupancy`. 
- Grouping in `summarise()` by organisations using `.by = `.
- `mutate()` the new 2 column data frame to create a percentage using the totals 
(occ / beds) 
- Order to find highest by using `arrange()`
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10,
                     color_border = "#005EB8",
                     color_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_running_text = "white",
                     color_running_background = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
                     color_finished_background = "white",
                     margin = "0.9em",
                     font_size = "2em")
```

## Solutions

```{r}
beds_data |> 
  summarise(total_beds = sum(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_occupancy = sum(occ_av, na.rm = TRUE),
            .by = org_name) |> 
  mutate(perc_occ = total_occupancy / total_beds) |> 
  arrange(desc(perc_occ))

```
</br>
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Answer using the group_by() function"
beds_data |> 
  group_by(org_name) |> 
  summarise(total_beds = sum(beds_av, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_occupancy = sum(occ_av, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  mutate(perc_occ = total_occupancy / total_beds) |> 
  arrange(desc(perc_occ))

```
